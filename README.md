# Architecture and Toolkit

The general goal of the WHOW Toolkit is to enable the creation of a knowledge graph that represents data about water quality and health parameters coming from heterogeneous sources and open data formats that are currently a knowledge soup that can be hardly accessed, queried, interpreted and managed homogeneously. Accordingly, we envision a modular set of tools that can be customised and configured in a decentralised fashion.
